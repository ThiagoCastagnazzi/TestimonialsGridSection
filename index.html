I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. Thet were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the enxt in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred dto it during interviews as a example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</blockquote>
